# Mailer

My undergraduate work (grade A awarded), a music website for email sending, was implemented by PHP. 

This experiment relies on Google WEB SPEECH API, through PHP, JS, HTML language to write a professional email sending webpage that can realize Text-to-speech, speech recognition, save mailbox content, save sending object, can realize single sending or group sending function.

The main logic of the web page implementation is: the front-end display and simple saving is mainly achieved by HTML and a small part of JS, the back-end call API interface, send mail, connection output input MySQL is mainly achieved by most JS and PHP.
